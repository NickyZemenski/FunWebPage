Simple MVC .Net Project

Just a simple web page (not finished yet) CRUD with a database N tier architechture and still being added to. 
Should look like a bookstore by the end.

based on the Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-aspnet-core-21-course/?couponCode=ST16MT28125AROW 
Still will have original implementations later on.
